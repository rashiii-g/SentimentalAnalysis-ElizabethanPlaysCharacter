Indeed, Nerissa, my small body is weary of this vast world.


Well-constructed sentences and well spoken.


If doing what is right were as easy as knowing what is good to do, chapels would be churches, and poor men's cottages would be princes' palaces. It is a good clergyman who follows his own advice. I can more easily teach twenty people what is right to be done than be one of the twenty to follow my own teachings. The mind may create rules for the emotions, but a passionate temper can override a rational decision. Madness, like a hare, leaps over the nets of good advice, just as a youth might skip over the constraints of wise counsel, like a cripple. But this reasoning is not in style for choosing a husband. Oh, the word 'choose'! I am not allowed to choose whom I want or reject whom I dislike; such is the will of a living daughter constrained by the will of a deceased father. Is it not difficult, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one and reject none?


I ask you, please, list them by name, and as you name them, I will describe them, and based on my description, aim my affection.


Yes, that's a young horse indeed, for he does nothing but talk about his horse, and he takes great pride in the fact that he can shoe him himself. I am quite afraid that his lady mother deceived a blacksmith.


He does nothing but frown, as if to say, 'If you won't have me, choose someone else.' He hears merry tales and doesn't smile. I fear he will become a melancholy philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I'd rather be married to a death's-head with a bone in its mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!


God made him, and therefore, let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it's a sin to be a mocker, but, he! Why, he has a horse better than the Neapolitan's, a more pronounced habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He is every man in no man; if a thrush sings, he starts dancing. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I'd be marrying twenty husbands. If he were to despise me, I would forgive him, for if he loves me to madness, I shall never repay him.


You know I say nothing to him, for he doesn't understand me, nor I him. He has neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor grasp of the English language. He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.


He has a neighborly charity in him, for he borrowed a box on the ear from an Englishman and swore he would pay him back when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another.




Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk. When he is at his best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is at his worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst thing that could happen, I hope I shall manage to do without him




Therefore, fearing the worst, I beg you, place a generous glass of Rhenish wine by the opposite casket. If the devil is within and temptation without, I know he will choose it. I'll do anything, Nerissa, before I'll be married to a spendthrift.
If I live to be as old as the Sibyl, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I'm won through the provisions of my father's will. I'm glad these suitors are so reasonable. There's not one among them that I don't prefer in his absence. I pray to God for a smooth departure for all of them.
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; I believe he was called so.
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of your praise.
[Enter a Serving-man] How now! What news?
If I could welcome the fifth suitor with as good a heart as I bid farewell to the other four, I would be happy about his arrival. If he has the qualities of a saint and the appearance of a devil, I would rather he confess my sins than marry me. Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go ahead. While we close the gates on one suitor, another knocks at the door.
In terms of choice, I am not solely led by the subtle cues from a maiden's eyes. Besides, my destiny is determined by a lottery that bars me from the right of voluntary choosing. If my father had not limited me and guided me with his wisdom, making me agree to be won by the one who solves the riddle, you, renowned prince, would have stood as fair a chance as any suitor I have seen so far for my affection.
You must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear, before making a choice, that if you choose wrong, you will never speak to a lady again in matters of marriage. Therefore, be advised.
First, let's go to the temple. After dinner, you'll take the risk.
Go draw aside the curtains and reveal the three caskets to this noble prince. Now make your choice.
The one of them contains my picture, prince. If you choose that, then I am yours entirely.
There, take it, prince; and if my likeness is there, then I am yours.
A graceful departure. Draw the curtains, go. Let all who share his qualities choose me so.
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince. If you choose the one that contains me, our wedding rites will be solemnized immediately. But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, you must leave here immediately.
To these conditions, everyone who comes to risk for my worthless self must swear.
Too long a pause for what you find there.
To offend and to judge are distinct actions and have opposite natures.
Thus, the candle has singed the moth. Oh, these deliberate fools! When they do choose, they have the wisdom, through their wit, to lose.
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
Here. What would my lord?
No more, I pray you. I am half afraid you will soon say he is related to you, spending such high-flown wit in praising him. Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see Cupid's messenger who comes so politely.
I pray you, wait. Pause for a day or two before you take the risk. In choosing wrong, I lose your company. Therefore, wait awhile. Something tells me, though it's not love, that I would not want to lose you. You know yourself that hatred doesn't counsel in such a situation. But, in case you don't understand me well (though a maiden has no tongue but thought), I would keep you here for a month or two before you venture for me. I could teach you how to choose correctly, but I am then forsworn; so I will never do that. May you miss me if you do, and may you make me wish for a sin that I had been forsworn. Cursed be your eyes, they have overlooked me and divided me. One half of me is yours, the other half yours. Mine own, I would say, but if mine, then yours, and so all yours. Oh, these wicked times that put barriers between owners and their rights! And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so, and let fortune go to hell for it, not I. I speak too long, but it's to delay the time, to extend it, and to draw it out, to keep you from making a choice.
Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess what treason is mingled with your love.
Ay, but I fear you speak under torture, where men forced can say anything.
Well then, confess and live.
Away, then! I am locked in one of them. If you love me, you will find me out. Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof. Let music sound while he makes his choice. Then, if he loses, he makes a graceful exit, fading away in music. May the comparison be more appropriate; my eye shall be the stream and watery deathbed for him. He may win, and what is music then? Music is like the flourish when true subjects bow to a newly crowned monarch. It's like those sweet sounds at the break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear and summon him to marriage. Now he goes, with no less presence but with much more love than young Alcides when he redeemed the virgin tribute paid by howling Troy to the sea monster. I stand as a sacrifice; the others stand aloof like the Dardanian wives with tear-streaked faces, coming forth to see the outcome of the challenge. Go, Hercules! Live, and I will live. I view the fight with much more dismay than you who make the fray. [Music plays while Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself] SONG. Tell me where is fancy bred, Or in the heart or in the head? How begot, how nourished? Reply, reply. It is engendered in the eyes, fed with gazing, and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies. Let us all ring fancy's knell. I'll begin it—Ding, dong, bell.
[Aside] How all the other passions fade away like doubtful thoughts, hastily embraced despair, and green-eyed jealousy! Oh, love, be moderate. Control your ecstasy; rein in your joy. Scant this excess. I feel too much of your blessing; make it less, for fear I overdose.
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand, such as I am. Though I wouldn't wish for myself alone to be ambitious, to wish myself much better, for you, I would be multiplied twenty times. A thousand times fairer, ten thousand times richer, just to stand high in your esteem. I might exceed in virtue, beauty, possessions, and friends, but the full sum of me is something, which, to put it bluntly, is an uneducated girl, inexperienced and unpracticed. Happy in this, she is not yet so old that she cannot learn. Happier than this, she is not so dull that she cannot learn. Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed, as if from her lord, her governor, her king. Myself and what is mine are now yours, my lord. I give them to you with this ring. When you part with, lose, or give away this ring, let it foretell the ruin of your love and be my advantage to complain about you.
Is this true, Nerissa?
So do I, my lord. They are entirely welcome.
There are some important contents in that same letter that have drained the color from Bassanio's face. Some dear friend must be dead; otherwise, nothing in the world could affect a man so much. What, worse and worse! With permission, Bassanio, I am half yourself, and I must have half of whatever this letter brings you.
My people already know my mind and will acknowledge you and Jessica in place of Lord Bassanio and myself. So farewell until we meet again.
I thank you for your wish and am well pleased to wish it back on you. Farewell, Jessica. [Exeunt Jessica and Lorenzo] Now, Balthasar, as I have always found you honest and true, let me find you still. Take this letter and use all the effort of a man to speed to Padua. See that you deliver this to my cousin, Doctor Bellario. And look, whatever notes and garments he gives you, bring them, I pray you, with imagined speed to the ferry that trades to Venice. Waste no time in words, but get going. I will be there before you.
Come on, Nerissa. I have work to do that you don't yet know about. We'll see our husbands before they think of us.
They shall, Nerissa. But in such a way that they will think we are endowed with what we lack. I'll bet you anything that when we are both dressed as young men, I'll prove to be the prettier of the two. I'll wear my dagger with a braver grace and speak with a reedy voice, alternating between the manners of a man and a boy. I'll turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and talk of fights like a fine, boastful youth. I'll tell quaint lies about how honorable ladies sought my love, and when I denied them, they fell sick and died. I couldn't help it. Then I'll repent and wish for all that, that I had not killed them. I'll tell twenty of these trivial lies, so that people will swear I have been out of school for over a year. I have a thousand tricks in my mind about these bragging fellows, which I will practice.




Fie, what a question that is,
If you were near a lewd interpreter!
But come, I'll tell you all my whole plan
When I am in my coach, which is waiting for us
At the park gate; and therefore, hurry away,
For we must cover twenty miles today.
I did, my lord.
I am thoroughly informed of the cause.
Which one of you is the merchant, and which is the Jew?
Is your name Shylock?
The suit you're pursuing is of a strange nature;
Yet it follows such rules that the Venetian law
Cannot challenge you as you proceed.
You stand within its danger, don't you?
Do you confess the bond?
Then the Jew must be merciful.
The quality of mercy is not strained,
It drops like gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath; it is twice blessed;
It blesses him that gives and him that takes.
It's mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His scepter shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein sits the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptered sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power then shows most like God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be your plea, consider this,
That in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we pray for mercy;
And that same prayer teaches us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoken this much
To mitigate the justice of your plea;
Which if you follow, this strict court of Venice
Must give a sentence against the merchant there.
Is he not able to discharge the money?
It must not be; there is no power in Venice
That can alter a decree established;
It will be recorded as a precedent,
And many errors, by the same example,
Will rush into the state; it cannot be.
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
Shylock, there's three times your money offered to you.
Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully, by this, the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take three times your money; ask me to tear up the bond.
Why then, thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
For the intent and purpose of the law
Has full relation to the penalty,
Which here appears due upon the bond.
Therefore, bare your bosom.
It is so. Are there scales here to weigh
The flesh?
Have a surgeon, Shylock, at your expense,
To stop his wounds, lest he bleed to death.
It is not so expressly stated, but what of that?
It would be good if you did so much for charity.
You, merchant, do you have anything to say?
Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
If she were here to hear you make the offer.
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is yours:
The court awards it, and the law gives it.
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
Wait a little; there is something else.
This bond does not give you any drop of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Take then your bond, take your pound of flesh;
But in cutting it, if you shed
One drop of Christian blood, your lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscated
Unto the state of Venice.
Yourself shall see the act:
For, as you urge justice, be assured
You shall have justice, more than you desire.
Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
He shall have nothing but the penalty.




Therefore, prepare yourself to cut off the flesh.
Shed no blood, nor cut less nor more
But just a pound of flesh. If you cut more
Or less than a just pound, let it be only so much
As makes it light or heavy in substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple. Nay, if the scale turns
But in the estimation of a hair,
You die, and all your goods are confiscated.
Why does the Jew pause? Take your forfeiture.
He has refused it in the open court.
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
You shall have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be taken at your peril, Jew.
Wait, Jew.
The law has yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice
That if it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seeks the life of any citizen,
The party against whom he conspires
Shall seize half his goods; the other half
Goes to the privy coffer of the state.
And the offender's life lies at the mercy
Of the duke only, against all other voices.
In that predicament, I say, you stand;
For it appears, by manifest proceedings,
That indirectly and directly too
You have contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and you have incurred
The danger I mentioned earlier.
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
Are you contented, Jew? What do you say?
Clerk, draw up a deed of gift.
I humbly desire your grace's pardon:
I must away this night toward Padua,
And it is fitting I set forth immediately.
He is well paid that is well satisfied;
And I, delivering you, am satisfied
And therein do account myself well paid.
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me when we meet again.
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
[To Antonio]
Give me your gloves; I'll wear them for your sake.
[To Bassanio]
And for your love, I'll take this ring from you.
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more.
And you, in love, shall not deny me this.
I will have nothing else but only this;
And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.
You taught me first to beg; and now, methinks,
You teach me how a beggar should be answered.
That excuse serves many men to save their gifts.
And if your wife is not a madwoman,
And knows how well I have deserved the ring,
She would not hold out enmity forever,
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed,
And let him sign it. We'll away tonight
And be a day ahead of our husbands' return.
This deed will be well welcomed by Lorenzo.
That cannot be.
His ring I do accept most thankfully.
And so, I pray you, tell him. Furthermore,
I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
[Aside to Nerissa] You may, I warrant.
We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;
But we'll outface them and outswear them too.
[Aloud]
Away! Make haste. You know where I will tarry.
That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws its beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
So does the greater glory dim the less.
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Until the king is by, and then his state
Empties itself, as does an inland brook
Into the main of waters. Music, hark!
Nothing is good, I see, without respect.
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
The crow sings as sweetly as the lark
When neither is attended. And I think
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things, by season, are seasoned
To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace, ho! The moon sleeps with Endymion
And would not be awakened.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
By the bad voice.
We have been praying for our husbands' health,
Which, we hope, the better for our words,
Are they returned?
Go in, Nerissa;
Give orders to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence;
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
This night, methinks, is but the daylight sick.
It looks a little paler. It's a day
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
[Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano, and their followers]
Let me give light, but let me not be light.
For a light wife does make a heavy husband,
And never be Bassanio so for me.
But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
You should in all senses be much bound to him.
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
It must appear in other ways than words,
Therefore, I scant this breathing courtesy.
A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter?
You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
To part so lightly with your wife's first gift.
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it. And here he stands;
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause for grief:
If it were me, I should be mad at it.
What ring did you give my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received from me.
Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will never come in your bed
Until I see the ring.
If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
Or your own honor to retain the ring,
You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for it, but some woman had the ring.
Let not that doctor ever come near my house.
Since he has got the jewel that I loved,
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you;
I'll not deny him anything I have,
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
If you do not, if I am left alone,
Now, by mine honor, which is yet mine own,
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
Sir, grieve not; you are welcome notwithstanding.
Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
And there's an oath of credit.
Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other.
I had it from him: pardon me, Bassanio;
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed.
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
And even but now returned; I have not yet
Entered my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbor suddenly:
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter.
How now, Lorenzo!
My clerk has some good comforts too for you.
It is almost morning,
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full. Let us go in;
And charge us there upon interrogatories,
And we will answer all things faithfully.
