Three thousand ducats; okay.
For three months; okay.
Antonio will be the guarantor; okay.
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio is the guarantor.
Antonio is a good man.
Oh, no, no, no, no: when I say he is a good man, I mean he has enough money. But his money is risky: he has a ship going to Tripoli, another to India; I also heard that he has a third one in Mexico, a fourth one in England, and other ventures abroad1. But ships are just wood, sailors are just men: there are rats on land and water, thieves on land and water, I mean pirates, and then there are the dangers of water, wind and rocks2. But he has enough money, I think. Three thousand ducats; I think I can lend him that.
I want to be sure I can; and, to be sure, I will think about it. Can I talk to Antonio?
Yes, to smell pork; to eat from the house that your prophet said the devil lived in3. I will buy from you, sell to you, talk to you, walk with you, and so on, but I will not eat with you, drink with you, or pray with you4. What’s new in the market? Who is coming here?
[Aside] How he looks like a flattering tax collector! I hate him because he is a Christian, but more because he lends money for free and lowers the interest rate here in Venice5. If I can catch him once in a weak spot, I will satisfy the old grudge I have against him. He hates our people, and he insults me, even where merchants gather, about my money and my interest. Cursed be my people, if I forgive him
I am thinking about my current money, and, by my memory, I cannot raise three thousand ducats right away7. So what? Tubal, a rich Jew of my people, will lend me some. But wait! how many months do you want? [To ANTONIO] Greetings, good sir; you were the last person we talked about.
Yes, yes, three thousand ducats.
I forgot; three months; you told me that. Well then, your contract; and let me see; but listen to me; you said you don’t lend or borrow money with interest.
When Jacob looked after his uncle Laban’s sheep— this Jacob was from our ancestor Abraham, and his mother helped him, he was the third owner; yes, he was the third—
No, not take interest, not, as you would say, directly interest: notice what Jacob did. When Laban and he agreed that all the lambs that were striped and spotted would be Jacob’s pay, the sheep, being horny, in the end of autumn mated with the rams, and, when they were mating, the clever shepherd peeled some sticks, and, while they were doing it, he put them in front of the pregnant sheep, who then gave birth to striped and spotted lambs, and those were Jacob’s. This was a way to succeed, and he was blessed: and saving money is a blessing, if people don’t steal it.
I don’t know; I make it grow as fast as I can: but pay attention, sir.
Three thousand ducats; it’s a good round sum. Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the interest—
Sir Antonio, many times and often in the market you have criticized me about my money and my interest: I have always endured it with a patient shrug, because that’s what our people do. You call me a unbeliever, a cut-throat dog, and spit on my Jewish coat, and all for using my own money8. Well then, it seems you need my help: so, then; you come to me, and you say ‘Shylock, we want money:’ you say so; you, that spat on my beard and kicked me like a stray dog over your doorstep: money is what you want9. What should I say to you? Should I not say 'Does a dog have money? is it possible a dog can lend three thousand ducats?'7 Or should I bend low and in a slave’s voice, with quiet breath and whispering humbleness, say this; ‘Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last; you kicked me on another day; another time you called me dog; and for these kindnesses I’ll lend you this much money’?10
Why, look how you get angry! I want to be friends with you and have your love, forget the insults that you have stained me with, help your current needs and take no interest for my money, and you won’t listen to me: this is the kindness I offer11.
This is the kindness I will show. Go with me to a lawyer, sign me there your contract; and, as a joke, if you don’t pay me on such a day, in such a place, such amount or amounts as are written in the contract, let the penalty be a pound of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken from any part of your body that I choose.
Oh, father Abraham, what these Christians are, whose own hard dealings make them suspect the thoughts of others! Please, tell me this; if he doesn’t pay on time, what will I gain by taking the penalty? A pound of human flesh taken from a man is not as valuable or useful as flesh of sheep, cows, or goats. I say, to buy his favor, I offer this friendship: if he will take it, fine; if not, goodbye; and, for my love, don’t wrong me.
Then meet me right away at the lawyer’s; tell him to prepare this funny contract, and I will go and get the money right away, check on my house, left in the care of a careless servant, and soon I will be with you.
Well, you will see, your eyes will be the judge, the difference between old Shylock and Bassanio:— What, Jessica!—you will not overeat, as you have done with me:—What, Jessica!— and sleep and snore, and tear clothes apart;— Why, Jessica, I say!
Who told you to call? I didn’t tell you to call.
I am invited out to dinner, Jessica: here are my keys. But why should I go?12 I am not invited for love; they flatter me: but I’ll go in hate, to eat the wasteful Christian13. Jessica, my girl, look after my house14. I don’t want to go: there is some bad thing coming towards my rest, because I dreamed of money-bags tonight15.
So do I his.
What, are there masks? Listen to me, Jessica: lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum and the horrible sound of the twisted flute, don’t climb up to the windows then, nor stick your head into the public street to look at Christian fools with painted faces, but close my house’s ears, I mean my windows: don’t let the noise of shallow foolishness enter my serious house16. By Jacob’s staff, I swear, I don’t feel like going out tonight: but I will go17. You go ahead of me, boy; say I will come.
What does that idiot of Hagar’s son say, huh?
The clown is nice enough, but a huge eater; slow in making money, and he sleeps by day more than the wild-cat: lazy people don’t work with me; so I get rid of him, and get rid of him to one that will help him waste his borrowed money. Well, Jessica, go in; maybe I will come back right away: do as I told you; close the doors after you: tie fast, find fast; a saying never old in thrifty mind.
You know, better than anyone, better than anyone as you, of my daughter’s escape.
She is damned for it.
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
There I have another bad deal: a bankrupt, a spender, who barely dares to show his face in the market; a beggar, that used to look so neat in the market; let him watch his contract: he used to call me a moneylender; let him watch his contract: he used to lend money for a Christian kindness; let him watch his contract.
To bait fish with: if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He has disgraced me, and cost me half a million; laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my people, ruined my deals, cooled my friends, heated my enemies; and what’s his reason?18 I am a Jew19. Doesn’t a Jew have eyes? doesn’t a Jew have hands, organs, dimensions, senses, feelings, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is?20 If you prick us, don’t we bleed? if you tickle us, don’t we laugh? if you poison us, don’t we die? and if you wrong us, won’t we revenge?21 If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that22. If a Jew wrongs a Christian, what is his humility?23 Revenge25. If a Christian wrongs a Jew, what should his punishment24 be by Christian example? Why, revenge1. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction2.
I am sorry for you: you are going to lose your money.
I am sorry that you will leave my company: but, fair enough, I was about to tell you something, but I’ll keep it to myself: it is dinner time, and I must go eat.
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he called.
Yes, yes, he was the one; Mr. Antonio.
I am sure, if he loses, you will not take his flesh: what’s that good for?
To bait fish with. If it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He has disgraced me, and cost me half a million; laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my people, ruined my deals, cooled my friends, heated my enemies; and what’s his reason?3 I am a Jew4.

If a Jew wrongs a Christian, what is his humility?8 Revenge1. If a Christian wrongs a Jew, what should his punishment be by Christian example?9 Why, revenge1. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction2.
Sign me there. Here is the money.
Soft! The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste: he shall have nothing but the penalty.
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge? ‘Nearest his heart:’ those are the very words10.
It is so. Are there balance here to weigh the flesh?
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, to stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
Is it so nominated in the bond?
Not so: I see, sir, you are liberal in offers; you taught me first to beg; now, methinks, you teach me how a beggar should be answered.
Good sir, this ring was given to me by my wife; and when she put it on, she made me swear that I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts. An if your wife be not a mad-woman, and know how well I have deserved the ring, she would not hold out enemy for ever, for giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
I thank you, good Tubal: good news, good news! ha, ha! where? in Genoa?
I thank thee, good Tubal: give me thy hand, man: I am sorry I did not see thee: I thank thee, good Tubal.
I am glad of it: I’ll plague him; I’ll torture him: I am glad of it.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor: I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys11.
But Tubal, what news from Genoa? how is that royal merchant, good Antonio? do you know of his losses at sea?
I would be glad of it: I would give all my wealth, which is already much, to deliver Antonio, the Christian, to his enemies.
Meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.
What, Jessica!—you will not overeat, as you have done with me:—What, Jessica!— and sleep and snore, and tear clothes apart;— Why, Jessica, I say!
