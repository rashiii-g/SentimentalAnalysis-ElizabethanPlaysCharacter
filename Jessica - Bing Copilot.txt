I'm sorry you have to leave my father like this. Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil, made it less boring¹[1]. But goodbye, here is a coin for you. And, Launcelot, you'll see Lorenzo at dinner, he's a guest of your new master. Give him this letter, do it secretly, and farewell. I don't want my father to see me talking with you.






Goodbye, good Launcelot³[3]. (Launcelot exits) Alas, what a terrible sin it is for me to be ashamed of being my father's child⁴[4]. But even though I share his blood, I don't share his manners⁵[5]. O Lorenzo, if you keep your promise, I'll end this conflict, become a Christian and your loving wife⁶[6].


What do you want? What is your will?




 He said 'Goodbye mistress', nothing else⁷[7].


 Goodbye, and if I'm not unlucky, I'll lose a father and you'll lose a daughter⁸[8].


 Who are you?⁹[9] Tell me, to be more sure, even though I swear I know your voice.






 Lorenzo, for sure, and my love indeed, for who do I love so much?¹¹[11] And now who knows but you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?¹²[12]






 Here, catch this box, it's worth the trouble¹⁴[14]. I'm glad it's night, you can't see me, because I'm very ashamed of my disguise. But love is blind and lovers can't see the silly things they do. For if they could, Cupid himself would blush to see me transformed into a boy.






 What, do I have to hold a candle to my shames?¹⁶[16] They are too light by themselves¹⁷[17]. Why, it's a job of revealing, love, and I should be hidden.






 I'll lock the doors and take some more money, and I'll be with you soon.




 When I was with him I heard him swear to Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, that he would rather have Antonio's flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he owed him²²[22]. And I know, my lord, if law, authority and power don't stop him, it will go badly with poor Antonio.




 I wish you all the happiness of your heart.






 And what hope is that, I pray you?






 That would be a kind of illegitimate hope indeed, so my mother's sins would be visited on me.




 I'll be saved by my husband, he made me a Christian²⁷[27].


 I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say²⁸[28]. Here he comes.




 No, you don't need to fear us, Lorenzo[^30^][30]. Launcelot and I are done. He tells me plainly, there is no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter³¹[31]. And he says, you are no good member of the commonwealth, for by converting Jews to Christians, you raise the price of pork.




 Beyond all expression. It is very fitting that the Lord Bassanio live an upright life, for having such a blessing in his lady, he finds the joys of heaven here on earth³⁵[35]. And if he doesn't mean it on earth, then he should never come to heaven. Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match and bet two earthly women, and Portia one, there must be something else staked with the other, for the poor rude world has no equal to her.






 No, but ask my opinion too of that³⁶[36].




 No, let me praise you while I have an appetite³⁸[38].




 Well, I'll show you the way.


 In such a night Thisbe fearfully stepped over the dew and saw the lion's shadow before himself and ran away scared⁴¹[41].




 In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs that made old Aeson young again.






 In such a night young Lorenzo swore he loved her well, stealing her soul with many vows of faith and never a true one⁴⁴[44].




 I would outdo you, if no one came. But listen, I hear someone's footsteps.


 I'm never happy when I hear sweet music⁴⁶[46].
