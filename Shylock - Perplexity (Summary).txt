What would you have a snake bite you twice? What judgment do you fear, if you were to lend money in six parts and each part was a dollar, and you didn't receive all the dollars? I wouldn't lend them, I would have my contract. What judgment do you fear, doing no wrong? You have many slaves among you, which you use in lowly and servile roles because you bought them. Should I say to you, 'Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?' Why do they sweat under burdens? Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let their palates be seasoned with delicious food. You will answer, 'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you: The pound of flesh, which I demand from him, is dearly bought, it's mine, and I will have it. If you deny me, curse upon your law! There is no power in the decrees of Venice. I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it? To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there. No, none that you have wit enough to make. Till you can rail the seal from off my bond, you only offend your lungs by speaking so loud. Repair your wit, young man, or it will fall into ruin. I stand here for the law. Shylock is my name. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that. My deeds are upon my head! I crave the law, the penalty, and forfeit of my bond. A Daniel come to judgment! Yes, a Daniel! O wise young judge, how I honor you! Here is my oath, an oath in heaven: Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No, not for Venice. When it is paid according to the tenor, it doth appear you are a worthy judge; you know the law, your exposition has been most sound. I charge you by the law, whereof you are a well-deserving pillar, proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me: I stay here on my bond.
