Three thousand ducats; okay.


For three months; alright.


Antonio will be obligated; fine.


Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio committed.


Antonio is a good man.


Oh, no, no, no, no: when I say he's a good man, I mean he's reliable. But his resources are hypothetical: he has a ship bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; I've heard he also has a third in Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures scattered abroad. But ships are just timber, sailors are just men: there are land-dwellers and seafarers, water-thieves and land-thieves, I mean pirates, and then there's the danger of waters, winds, and rocks. Nevertheless, the man is reliable. Three thousand ducats; I believe I can take his bond.


I need to make sure I can; and to be sure of that,
I'll consider. Can I speak with Antonio?


Yes, for business; to take advantage of the dwelling which
your prophet the Nazarite used to exorcise the devil into. I'll trade with you, negotiate with you, converse with you,
stroll with you, and so forth, but I won't dine
with you, drink with you, or pray with you. What's the news on the Rialto? Who's coming here?


[Aside] He looks like a flattering merchant!
I hate him because he's a Christian,
But more because in his simple-mindedness
He lends money for free and reduces
the interest rate here in Venice.
If I can catch him in a vulnerable position,
I will take advantage of the old grudge I have against him.
He despises our sacred community and insults us,
Even where merchants usually gather,
Criticizing me, my deals, and my hard-earned profits,
Which he terms as interest. My people be cursed,
If I forgive him!


I am considering my current funds,
And, from what I remember,
I can't immediately gather
The full three thousand ducats. What about that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew from my community,
Will provide. But wait! How many months
Do you want?
[To ANTONIO]
Rest well, good sir;
You were the last topic of discussion.


Yes, yes, three thousand ducats.


I had forgotten; three months; you mentioned it. Alright then, your bond; and let me see; but listen;
I thought you said you neither lend nor borrow
For profit.


When Jacob tended his uncle Laban's sheep—
This Jacob, a descendant of our holy Abram,
As his wise mother intervened on his behalf,
The third possessor; yes, he was the third—


No, not charge interest, not, as you might say,
Directly charge interest: understand what Jacob did.
When Laban and he reached an agreement
That all the streaked and spotted lambs
Would belong to Jacob, the rank ewes,
At the end of autumn, mated with the rams,
And, during the act of breeding,
The skilled shepherd placed certain rods,
And, while this act was taking place,
He set them up before the ewes in heat,
Who then, in their time of giving birth,
Delivered lambs with different coloration, and those were Jacob's.
This was a method to prosper, and he was blessed:
And thriftiness is a blessing, if not stolen.


I can't say; I'm making it grow rapidly:
But understand this, sir.


Three thousand ducats; it's a significant amount.
Three months from twelve; then, let me calculate; the rate—


Signior Antonio, many times
At the Rialto, you've criticized me
About my money and my business practices:
Yet I've borne it with a patient attitude,
For tolerance is characteristic of our community.
You call me an unbeliever, a ruthless dog,
And spit on my Jewish attire,
All for using what's rightfully mine.
But now, it seems you need my help:
Come on, then; you come to me, and you say
'Shylock, we need money:' you say that;
You, who spat on my beard
And treated me like you would a stray dog
At your doorstep: money is what you seek.
What should I say to you? Should I not say,
'Does a dog have money? Is it possible
That a mutt can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Should I bend low and speak like a slave,
With a subdued tone and humble whisper, say this;
'Kind sir, you spat on me last Wednesday;
You scorned me on such a day; another time
You called me a dog; and for these kindnesses
I'll lend you this much money'?


Why, look at how you rage!
I want to be friends with you and have your respect,
Forget the humiliations you've subjected me to,
Help with your immediate needs, and ask for no interest
On my money, but you won't listen:
This kindness I offer.


This kindness I'll display.
Come with me to a notary, sign a bond there
Agreeing to repay me on a certain day,
In a certain place, with the specified amount
As mentioned in the agreement, or else
Face the consequence of forfeiting
An equivalent pound of your flesh,
To be taken from whatever part of your body I desire.


Oh father Abram, see what these Christians are like,
Whose own harsh dealings make them suspect
The intentions of others! Tell me this:
If he fails to keep his promise, what do I gain
By demanding the forfeit?
A pound of human flesh taken from a man
Is not as valuable or profitable,
As the flesh of sheep, cattle, or goats. I say,
To win his favor, I offer this friendship:
If he accepts it, fine; if not, goodbye;
And, for my love's sake, I beg you not to wrong me.


Then meet me immediately at the notary's;
Give him instructions for this binding agreement,
And I'll go and collect the ducats right away,
Attend to my house, left guarded in fear
By an irresponsible servant, and soon
I will join you.


Well, you shall see, your judgment will decide,
The contrast between old Shylock and Bassanio:—
What, Jessica!—you won't indulge excessively,
As you have done with me:—What, Jessica!—
And sleep, and snore, and tear clothes apart;—
Why, Jessica, I say!


Who asked you to call? I didn't ask you to call.


I've been invited for dinner, Jessica:
There are my keys. But why should I go?
I'm not invited out of love; they flatter me:
But I'll go out of spite, to feast upon
The wasteful Christian. Jessica, my girl,
Take care of my house. I'm very reluctant to go:
There's some trouble brewing that affects my peace,
For I dreamt of money bags tonight.


So did I dream.


"What, are there parties? Listen to me, Jessica: Lock up my doors. When you hear the drum and the annoying sound of the fife, don't climb up to the windows, nor stick your head out to see the Christian fools with their pretentious faces. Keep my house shut off from that shallow frivolity. I swear, I have no desire to go feasting tonight, but I will. You go ahead, sir; tell them I'll come.


Hey, what's that fool saying about Hagar's offspring, huh?


The servant is courteous enough but a massive eater, incredibly slow in making a profit, and sleeps during the day more than a wild cat. Lazy people don't thrive with me. That's why I'm letting him go and giving him away to someone who might use him to waste their borrowed money. Well, Jessica, go inside. I might return soon. Do as I told you; close the doors after you. Secure things to find things—a timeless proverb in a thrifty mind.


You know about my daughter's elopement better than anyone.


She's condemned for it.


My own child rebels against me!


I say, my daughter is my own flesh and blood.


Another terrible match: a bankrupt, a spendthrift who barely dares to show his face on the Rialto. A beggar who used to stroll through the market so confidently. Let him attend to his agreement: he used to call me a usurer; let him attend to his agreement: he used to lend money out of courtesy for Christians; let him attend to his agreement.


To attract fish, even if it feeds on nothing else, it will feed my desire for revenge. He's shamed me, hindered me by half a million; laughed at my losses, mocked my gains, disrespected my community, ruined my deals, cooled off my friends, and heated up my enemies. And what's his reason? Because I'm a Jew. Doesn't a Jew have eyes? Doesn't a Jew have hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt by the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian? If you prick us, don't we bleed? If you tickle us, don't we laugh? If you poison us, don't we die? And if you wrong us, won't we seek revenge? If we resemble you in every way, we'll seek revenge too. If a Jew wrongs a Christian, what's his response? Revenge. If a Christian wrongs a Jew, what should his response be based on Christian teachings? Again, revenge. The villainy you've taught me, I'll execute, and I'll perfect the lesson.


How are you, Tubal? What news from Genoa? Have you found my daughter?


Oh, it's terrible! A diamond gone, costing me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never affected our people till now; I never felt it until now: two thousand ducats lost, along with other precious jewels. I wish my daughter were dead at my feet, and the jewels in her ear! I wish she were buried at my feet, and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? And I don't know what's been spent in the search. Loss upon loss! The thief got away with so much, and we've spent so much trying to find the thief, but no satisfaction, no revenge. No stroke of luck except what affects me negatively; no sighs except mine; no tears except mine.


What's wrong, what's wrong? Bad luck?


Thank God, thank God. Is it true?


Thank you, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha! Where? In Genoa?


You've driven a dagger into me: I'll never see my gold again: eighty ducats in one go! Eighty ducats!


I'm very glad about it. I'll trouble him; I'll torment him; I'm glad about it.


Forget her! You're tormenting me, Tubal: it was my turquoise; I got it from Leah when I was single: I wouldn't have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.


Well, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, get me an officer; arrange it two weeks in advance. I'll have his heart if he defaults; even if he's out of Venice, I can manipulate any transaction I want. Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.


Gaoler, look after him; don't talk to me about mercy. This is the fool who lent out money for free. Gaoler, watch him.


I'll have my bond; don't speak against my bond; I've sworn an oath that I'll have my bond. You called me a dog without reason, but since I'm a dog, beware of my bite. The Duke will grant me justice. I wonder, you foolish gaoler, why you're so fond of coming out with him when he asks.


I'll have my bond; I won't listen to you speak; I'll have my bond; so, speak no more. I won't become a soft, weak-eyed fool, shaking my head, feeling remorse, sighing, and giving in to Christian intercessors. Don't follow me; I don't want to talk. I want my bond.


I've told your grace what I intend; and by our holy Sabbath, I've sworn to get the due forfeit of my bond. If you deny it, let the danger fall on your charter and the freedom of your city. You'll ask me why I'd prefer a pound of flesh instead of receiving three thousand ducats. I won't answer that. What if my house is troubled by a rat and I'm willing to pay ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated? Are you answered yet? Some people don't like a gaping pig; some go mad if they see a cat; and others, when a bagpipe plays, can't control their bladder. Affection, the ruler of emotions, controls what we like or dislike. Now, for your answer: just as there's no solid reason to explain why he can't stand a gaping pig, a harmless necessary cat, or a woollen bagpipe, but has to give in to the inevitable shame of offending himself while being offended, similarly, I can't give a reason other than my deep-seated hatred and definite dislike for Antonio, which is why I'm pursuing this losing case against him. Are you satisfied?


I don't have to please you with my answers.


Does anyone hate something they wouldn't kill?


Would you let a snake sting you twice?


Why should I fear judgment for doing what's right? Even if my debts were split into six parts, each part a ducat, I wouldn't relinquish them; I'd want my bond.


Why should I dread judgment if I'm not doing wrong? Among you, there are many purchased slaves who, like your donkeys, dogs, and mules, you use in lowly and servile roles because you bought them. Should I tell you to set them free, marry them off to your heirs? Why do they to


il under burdens? Why not make their beds as comfortable as yours and let them eat the same food? Your answer would be, 'The slaves are ours.' So, I respond in kind: the pound of flesh I demand from him is dearly bought; it's mine, and I'll have it. If you deny me, shame on your law! The decrees of Venice hold no power. I stand for judgment; answer me: shall I have it?


To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.


No, none that you have the intelligence to make.


Until you can remove the seal from my bond, you're only straining your voice by speaking so loudly. Mend your intelligence, young man, or it'll crumble into irreparable ruin. I stand here for justice.


Shylock is my name.


Under what compulsion must I? Tell me that.


I'm responsible for my actions! I demand justice, the penalty, and the forfeit of my bond.


A wise judge has come to pass judgment! Yes, a Daniel! Oh, wise young judge, how I honor you!


Here it is, most revered doctor; here it is.


I've sworn an oath, an oath in heaven. Shall I commit perjury? No, not for Venice.


When it's paid according to the agreement. It's clear you're a worthy judge; you know the law, your explanation has been sound. I charge you by the law, of which you are a well-deserving pillar, proceed to judgment. I swear by my soul that no one can persuade me otherwise. I stand by my bond.


Oh noble judge! Oh excellent young man!


That's very true; oh, wise and upright judge! You're much older in wisdom than in appearance.


Yes, his chest. So says the bond, doesn't it, noble judge? 'Nearest his heart,' those are the exact words.


I have them prepared.


Is it mentioned in the bond?


I can't find it; it's not in the bond.


These are the Christian husbands. I have a daughter; I wish any of Barrabas's offspring had been her husband rather than a Christian! [Aside] We're wasting time. Please, give the sentence.


Most rightful judge!


Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!


Is that the law?


I accept this offer then; pay me thrice the bond, and let the Christian go.


Give me my principal, and let me go.


Can't I at least have my principal amount?


Then may the devil make good use of it! I won't entertain any more questions.


No, take my life and everything; don't pardon that. You take my house when you take away the support that holds my house together; you take my life when you take away the means by which I survive.


I agree.


Please, allow me to leave from here; I'm not well. Send the deed after me, and I'll sign it.
